   * The render function may be invoked twice during an error cycle:

   *

   * your fallback relies on `componentStack`.
   *
   * @param error - The Error thrown by the descendant component. Always
   *   defined when the fallback is invoked, because the boundary only enters
   *   the error state when an Error is present.
   * @param errorInfo - React's {@link ErrorInfo}, containing `componentStack`.
